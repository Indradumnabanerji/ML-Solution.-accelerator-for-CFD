This code is an attempt to physics informed neural networks â€“ neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given law of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations.   The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information.
